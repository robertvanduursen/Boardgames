Take this, to celebrate our acquaintance.%Beast hunting is a sacred practice. May the good blood guide your way. There must be oodles for us to share.%Go on, just tell me what piques your interest.%As you know, the Healing Church is the fountainhead of blood healing. Well, I'm a simple hunter, quite unfamiliar with the ins and outs of the institution. I have heard that the holy medium of blood healing is venerated in the main cathedral. And that councilors of the old church reside in the high stratum of the Cathedral Ward. If you seek blood healing, and the church is willing, you should pay them a visit.%Byrgenwerth is an old place of learning. The tomb of the gods, carved out below Yharnam, should be familiar to every hunter. Well, once a group of young Byrgenwerth scholars discovered a holy medium deep within the tomb. This led to the founding of the Healing Church, and the establishment of blood healing. In this sense, everything sacred in Yharnam can be traced back to Byrgenwerth. But today, the college lies deep within a tangled wood, abandoned and decrepit. And furthermore, the Healing Church has declared Byrgenwerth forbidden ground. It's unclear how many of its scholars remain alive... ...but only they know the password that allows passage through the gate.%Well, that’s most unfortunate. But, if you have a change of heart,you know where to come. We are, after all, fellow hunters and tonight we hunt!%Oh, changed our mind, have we? Then perhaps we can co-operate and discuss what we’ve learned.%I bid you farewell. It has been a pleasure. %May the good blood guide your way.%Oh-hoh! Good to see you safe. Now, let’s think up something to discuss. Just tell me what piques your interest.%Ah-hah! There’s something I want to tell you. A bit of a wisdom from the eminent Master Logarius. Once, a scholar betrayed his fellows at Byrgenwerth and brought forbidden blood back with him to Cainhurst Castle. It was there that the first of the inhuman Vilebloods was born, The Vilebloods are fiendish creatures who threaten the purity of the Church’s blood healing. The rule of the Vilebloods is still alive today, and so to honor my Master’s wishes, I search for the path to Cainhurst Castle.%In his time, Master Logarius led his executioners into Cainhurst Castle to cleanse it of the Vilebloods. But all did not go well and Master Logarius became a blessed anchor guarding us from evil. Tragic, tragic times.. that Master Logarius should be abandoned in the accursed domain of the Vilebloods. I must free him so that he may be properly honored in martyrdom.%Just what is the meaning of this? Why turn your blade on me? You let the blood get the best of you… he he he%You’ll regret this…%Ah-hah! Is that the sigil of Cainhurst? I’ve heard tell of Cainhurst nobles and their amusingly pompous invitations.%Wonderful!

valtr#%Convenant leader of The League%Valtr is the sole survivor of a trio of constables who once chased a beast from a neighboring region all the way to Yharnam. His two comrades were slain by the beast, but he in turn dispatched the creature and devoured its entire corpse by himself. This led Valtr to discover the "Impurity" rune, which allows its bearer to see Vermin - the root of man's impurity. Valtr resolved to expunge all Vermin in the name of ultimate purification and formed the League of Confederates to further this all but unattainable goal. The endless march of time has slowly eroded his strength, and in his advancing age he now seeks a candidate worthy enough to take his place as Master of the League.%Ahh, a new face, are you?%And an accomplished hunter...%it would appear.%I am Valtr, Master of the League.%Members of the League cleanse the streets%of all the filth that's spread about during the hunt.%Like any half-decent hunter ought to, you know?%Haven't you seen enough of these wretched beasts,%freakish slugs, and mad doctors?%Sentence these fiends to death.%With the help of your League confederates.%What do you say?

threaded cane#%One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used by those who dedicate themselves to the hunt.%Sufficiently deadly as a rigid bladed cane, but also serves as a whip when its blade is split into many.%Concealing the weapon inside the cane and flogging the beasts with the whip is partly an act of ceremony, an attempt to demonstrate to oneself that the bloodlust of the hunt will never encroach upon the soul.%.
tonitrus#%A unique trick weapon contrived by Archibald, the infamous eccentric of the Healing Church workshop.%Striking this peculiar iron morning star flail like a match generates the same blue sparks that blanket a darkbeast.%Unfortunately, for reasons untold, the hunters of Archibald's time did not fully take to the device.%.
